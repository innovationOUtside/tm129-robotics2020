# VLE Material

This material is a draft of what we might expect to see on the VLE.

In common with other modules, it might make sense for the [*Software Guide*](https://innovationoutside.github.io/tm129-robotics2020/#software-guide) to appear in the VLE as well as via the distributed environment. This makes it linkable to from forum posts etc if students need referring to it.

It might also be useful to post the [READ ME FIRST](https://innovationoutside.github.io/tm129-robotics2020/#read-me-first) on the VLE as well, perhaps different titled, perhaps as part of the software guide?

I'm not sure if the order of sections in the software guide should be jiggled around too?

## Week 1 - Robotics Practical Activities

In this week's activities, you will be introduced to the Open Computing Lab environmnt used for the activities, as well as the RoboLab simulator you will be using to programme a simulated robot. You will also install or otherwise access the necessary software and check that it all works...

First, read the overview of the robotics practical activities here: [READ ME FIRST](https://innovationoutside.github.io/tm129-robotics2020/content/00_READ_ME_FIRST/Section_00_01_Introduction.html).

Secondly, familiarise yourself with the contents of the complete software guide and work through the example activities: [Software Guide](https://innovationoutside.github.io/tm129-robotics2020/content/00_SOFTWARE_GUIDE/Section_00_01_Jupyter_environment.html).

To complete the activities, you will need to __install the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment__ by following  the guidance at: [Accessing RoboLab](https://innovationoutside.github.io/tm129-robotics2020/content/00_READ_ME_FIRST/Section_00_05_Accessing_RoboLab.html)

## Week 2 - Robotics Practical Activities

This week's activities provide an elementary guide to working with the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment, as well as a simple introduction to programming robots and programming in Python.

Launch the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment. You will find the materials for this week's activities in the `01_Robot_Lab` folder on the notebook server homepage (http://localhost:8129/tree/notebooks/content/01_Robot_Lab).

--

## Week 3 - Robotics Practical Activities

In this week's practical activities, you will learn a bit more about various program control structures such as loops and conditional statement, as well as how they can be used in simple robot control programmes.

Launch the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment. You will find the materials for this week's activities in the `02_Robot_Lab` folder on the notebook server homepage (http://localhost:8129/tree/notebooks/content/02_Robot_Lab).

## Week 4 - Robotics Practical Activities

In this week's practical activities, you will learn how sensor readings can be used within a robot control programme to allow the robot to modify its behaviour based on what it senses by considering three control strategies as a simulated robot navigates itss environment:

- *dead reckoning* – no sensor input;

- *reflex behaviour* – sensors linked directly to motors according to the sense–act model;

- *deliberative behaviour* – actuation depends on reasoning about sensor information and other knowledge, according to the sense–think–act model.

Launch the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment. You will find the materials for this week's activities in the `03_Robot_Lab` folder on the notebook server homepage (http://localhost:8129/tree/notebooks/content/03_Robot_Lab).

## Week 5 - Robotics Practical Activities

In this week's practical activities, you will see how sensor noise can affect the way that a robot experiences the world, as well as various strategies for coping with noise when creating robot control programmes.

Launch the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment. You will find the materials for this week's activities in the `04_Robot_Lab` folder on the notebook server homepage (http://localhost:8129/tree/notebooks/content/04_Robot_Lab).

--

## Week 6 - Robotics Practical Activities

In this week's practical activities, you will consider how robots can navigate in the world, using ultrasound sensors to detect obstacles and motor tachometer sensors that allow the simulated robot to keep track of how far it has travelled, and a gyroscope to monitor the direction in which the robot is pointing.

Launch the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment. You will find the materials for this week's activities in the `05_Robot_Lab` folder on the notebook server homepage (http://localhost:8129/tree/notebooks/content/05_Robot_Lab).


--

## Week 7 - Robotics Practical Activities


In this week's practical activities, you will have an opportunity to experiment with the training and testing of some simple neural networks.

Launch the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment. You will find the materials for this week's activities in the `06_Robot_Lab` folder on the notebook server homepage (http://localhost:8129/tree/notebooks/content/06_Robot_Lab).

## Week 8 - Robotics Practical Activities

In the previous set of activities, you had an opportunity to experiment hands-on with neural networks. You may have finished that lab session wondering how neural networks can be built into real robots, particularly low-cost robots rather than expensive cutting-edge robots found only in research labs.

In this week's practical activities, you will see how neural networks might be used as part of a robot's control strategy as well as how a robot might form part of a multi-agent system in which it provides sensor information to another part of the system which analyses it and returns some sort of interpretation of the sensor data to the robot. The robot can then use this externally generated interpretation of the robot's sensor measurements as part of its own control programme.


Launch the TM129 Open Computing Lab environment. You will find the materials for this week's activities in the `07_Robot_Lab` folder on the notebook server homepage (http://localhost:8129/tree/notebooks/content/07_Robot_Lab).
