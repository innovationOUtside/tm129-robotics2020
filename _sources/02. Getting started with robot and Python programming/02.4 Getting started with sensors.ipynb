Reading the graph from left (the first sensor reading) to right (the last sensor reading), the line is horizontal at a y-value of 255 until an x-value of about 100, followed by a drop to about 220 until about x=145, at which point it climbs steeply back up to y=255, remaining at that level until about x=190. There is a further sharp drop to about (x, y) equal to (190, 210), then back up to 255 at about x=225, until another edge at about x=280 down to (280, 130); the chart then goes back up from about (320, 130) to (321, 255), then down to y=0 at about x=360, staying then until x is almost 410, at which point the line climbs back up to 255, stays there for a short while, and the trace ends.](../images/Section_00_03_-_charting.png)\n",
