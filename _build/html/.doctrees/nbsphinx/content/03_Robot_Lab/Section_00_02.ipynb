However, there is a problem with dead reckoning: *noise*.\n",

In a robot, noise might arise in the behaviour of the motors, the transmission or the wheels. The result is that the robot does not execute its motion without error. We can model noise effects in the mobility system of out robot by adding a small amount of noise to the motor speeds as the simulator runs. This noise componenent may speed up, or slow down, the speed of each motor, in a random way. As with real systems, the noise represents are slight random deviations from the theoretical, ideal behaviour."
