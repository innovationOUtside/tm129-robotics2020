Output ports are used to identify power and/or control lines that a software controller can use to control the behaviour of a physical (or simuluted) device, such as a motor, LED display, or speaker. In our simulated robot case, two output ports are defined, `OUTPUT_B` and `OUTPUT_C`.

    "Checkpoints are useful because they not only autosave the notebook to the current file, but they also save a hidden copy of the notebook in a checkpoints directory. The *File -> Revert to Checkpoint* menu option allows you to reload the previously checkpointed notebook. This is handy if you have made some changes to your notebook, those changes have been autosaved, and you find you want to revert to the previous version of the notebook where you made a conscious decision to save and checkpoint it.\n",
