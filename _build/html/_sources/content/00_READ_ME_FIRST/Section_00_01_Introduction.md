# Introduction

Welcome to the practical activities associated with Block 1 of TM129.

The aim of these practical sessions is to introduce you to some of the ways in which we can programme a simple simulated robot running inside a two-dimensional world simulator in your web browser. You will also have the opportunity to try out some simple artificial intelligence and machine learning programmes.

The main environment provided for working through the activities is a customised Jupyter notebook environment. Jupyter notebooks were originally designed to support reproducible computational data analysis and research. They are now commonly used across a wide range of disciplines, and are increasingly used to support interactive code-based tutorials as well as distributing teaching materials.

The programming language you will be using in this block is the Python programming language. If you have not used the Python programming language before, or even if you haven't done *any* programming before, *DON'T PANIC*. We have tried to take a pragmatic approach to demonstrating how use to Python code to *get things done*, and the provided examples show you all you need to know to programme the simulated robot yourself.

Although the interface to the programming activities is provided through a web browser (most reliably, the Chrome web-browser), the software supporting the activities run inside a virtual machine (you'll learn more about virtual machines later in the module).

To run the virtual machine locally, you will need to install the Docker application (we'll provide full guidance around this). It is also possible to run the application using free or paid for services on the web, and we provide some guidance on how to do this. However, you should be aware that free services may not always be available or reliable, and some are "free" only in exchange for someone else, such as personal registration data.
