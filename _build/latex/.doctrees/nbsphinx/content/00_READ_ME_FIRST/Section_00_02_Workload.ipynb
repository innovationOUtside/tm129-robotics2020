    "\n",
    "The RoboLab practical sessions have been written so that if you are an absolute beginner with no experience of robotics or programming you can complete the work each week in four to five hours. The pace is deliberately unhurried and we recommend you take your time. If you already have some programming experience RoboLab should take you less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week’s practical session combines two aspects of robotics. We will teach you the basics of programming in RoboLab, introducing features gradually during the sessions. You will also carry out some investigations using the simulated robot which will give you a taste of some of the more practical aspects of robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the RoboLab sessions you may encounter a number of activities that are labelled as ‘challenges’. We’ve defined these tasks as challenges because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- there may be several ways of achieving a solution to the task, rather than a single best approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- it may be possible to refine any particular solution and improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges implicitly incorporate some performance measure that you can use to rate the effectiveness of your solution, such as the time taken for the robot to complete a task, or the accuracy with which it does so. There is thus a mildly competitive element to the activity. You may not get the chance to compare your solution with those of other students, but you can think about trying to improve the quality of your own solution – though you should not spend too long trying for perfection!"

    "### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope that by the end of the RoboLab practical sessions you understand some of the basic ideas and can program the simulated robot to do some basic tasks. This should ensure that you can do the assignment and complete the block satisfactorily. The assessment will not include any material covered in optional practical activities."
