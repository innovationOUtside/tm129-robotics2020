Underneath, the same rules engine (which itself happens to be written in the C programming language) processes the facts and the rules to allow the system to reason.\n",

    "\n",
    "To see how this more comprehensive version of a rule based system works, let's consider the example of reasoning over a set of \"facts\" that are asserted as *subject predicate object* statements. Separate rules parse one or more of these statements and then try to general additional statements as a logical consequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facts might take the form *Sam is a student* where *Sam* is the subject of the statement, *student* is the object of the statement, and *is a* is a *predicate* that defines some sort of relationship between the subject and the object.\n",
