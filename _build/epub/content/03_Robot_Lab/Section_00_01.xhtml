<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>Sensors are at the heart of robotics. A machine without sensors cannot be a robot in our terms. The human body is replete with sensors. Our five external senses – sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste – and internal sensing such as balance and proprioception (body awareness) are all marvellously sophisticated.</p>
<p>In Robot Lab Session 4 we are concerned with how a robot can use this sensory information to control its actuators. We will investigate a progression of control strategies:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>dead reckoning – no sensor input</p></li>
<li><p>reflex behaviour – sensors <em>linked directly</em> to motors according to the sense–act model</p></li>
<li><p>deliberative behaviour – actuation depends on <em>reasoning</em> about sensor information and other knowledge, according to the sense–think–act model.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first control strategy, dead reckoning, is “open loop”, since it does not use sensor input.</p>
<p>The second is the sense–act control strategy that you encountered in Study week 2, and we will illustrate it using versions of Braitenberg’s vehicles (also introduced in Study week 2).</p>
<p>Finally, there is the most complex control strategy, in which the robot deliberates on the sensor inputs in the context of other knowledge. This involves <em>reasoning</em>, as discussed in Study week 3. This corresponds to the way humans solve complex problems and plan actions in the long and short term.</p>
