The path crosses over itself, forming a square loop at one end; this is then repeated until the path joins up with the beginning again. Overall the net effect is to produce a pattern that can be seen as five identical squares; one is placed centrally and the other four placed at each corner, diagonally outside so only the corner of each surrounding square meets a corner of the central square.
