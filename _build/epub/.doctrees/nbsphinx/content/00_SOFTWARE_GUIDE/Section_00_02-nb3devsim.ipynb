For example, `motor_pair` can be recognised as a single name, but `motor pair` would be treated as two names (`motor` and `pair`) and result in an error. You are free to make up names as you wish as long as they meet these simple rules. However, some names are already reserved for use as program commands and you must also avoid these names. \n",
