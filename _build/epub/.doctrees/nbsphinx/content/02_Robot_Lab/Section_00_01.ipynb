    "\n",
    "Loops and branches are powerful constructs in programming, and they are used extensively in almost all computer programs. In this lab session, I will introduce the different loop and branch statements provided by RoboLab. You will have an opportunity to see how they are used by working through the activities. We end the session with a number of challenges for you to attempt. These will give you practice in selecting and using different RobotLab statements."

    "To illustrate the idea of a loop it is helpful to use a swimming analogy. Suppose you want to swim 20 lengths of a swimming pool. The chances are you will want to monitor your progress by keeping count of the number of lengths you complete. So, at the start, your personal counter (you) will be set to ‘0’. After one length of the pool you add 1 to your counter. You also ask yourself ‘have I done 20 lengths yet?’ If the answer is ‘no’, you ‘loop back’ to swim another length. On completion of the second length you add 1 to your counter and ask yourself the question again. If the answer is ‘no’ you loop back and repeat the process once more. You keep going like this until the answer to the question is ‘yes’, at which point you will have completed 20 lengths of the pool and the loop will end:"

Once those instructions have been executed, control is passed back the top of the while loop and the test condition is evaluated again. If the while condition evaluates as false, control passes to the first statement after the while block.\n",
