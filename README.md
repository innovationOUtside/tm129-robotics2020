This repository defines the computing environment for the practical activities for the 20J update to the OU TM129 robotics block.

A Docker container image built from the repository using `repo2docker` is available on Dockerhub: [`ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020)

The repository also contains drafts of the practical activity teaching materials. These materials are "unpublished" and *Â©The Open University, 2020*; they are posted here purely to support commentary and review during development. The initial draft of the materials is essentially a recasting of the original materials and activities into a form that uses a new user environment (*Jupyter notebooks*) and new simulation environment (`Jyro`).
