    "# 4 Reasoning with Eliza\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, most of the programs we have considered are relatively straightforward in terms of their program flow, following a simple sequential structure that we can quite easily visualise using a flow chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have also seen how it is possible to get quite complex *emergent* behaviours from a robot control program when the robot is placed in an environment and it starts to interact with that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore how another approach to programming in the form of a simple *rule based system* can produce its own rich behaviours when combined with inputs that are in part provoked by the behaviour of the program itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the rule based system has a sequential control flow regulating it's own behaviour, the \"program\" it implements has am emergent feel to it as different independent rules respond to particular inputs and create outputs that other rules can then use as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many respects, the interacting rules set up a *reasoning system* allow the program not only to act on pieces of information it is provided with, but also create its own further pieces of information and add those to its reasoning process. In such a way, we can start to develop a *sense-think-act* system where the actions are determined by a potentially simple reasoning system but with its own complex emergent behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed mechanics of how a rule based system works is beyond the scope of this module, but we can still see what sort of effect it can have when we interact with a reimplementation of classic rule based system: *Eliza*."

A rule matches a provided input if the `KEYPHRASE` is contained in the text given to Eliza. The pattern-matched content in the text can then be extracted from the input and used in the output response given by Eliza.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rule-matching engine, written in Python, takes the user input, tries to match it with one of the rules and then generates a response.
