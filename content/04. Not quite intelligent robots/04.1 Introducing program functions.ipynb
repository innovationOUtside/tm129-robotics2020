    "# 1. Introduction to functions and robot control strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors are at the heart of robotics. A machine without sensors cannot be a robot in our terms. The human body is replete with sensors. Our five external senses – sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste – and internal sensing such as balance and proprioception (body awareness) are all marvellously sophisticated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week’s practical activities, we will be concerned with various techniques that can be used to allow a robot to use sensory information to control its actuators. We will investigate a progression of control strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. dead reckoning – no sensor input\n",
    "\n",
    "2. reflex behaviour – sensors *linked directly* to motors according to the sense–act model\n",
    "\n",
    "3. deliberative behaviour – actuation depends on *reasoning* about sensor information and other knowledge, according to the sense–think–act model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first control strategy, dead reckoning, is an ‘open-loop’ control approach, since it does not use sensor input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is an example of a ‘sense–act’ control strategy that you encountered earlier in the block; we will illustrate this control strategy using simulated implementations of simple Braitenberg vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is the most complex control strategy, in which the robot deliberates on the sensor inputs in the context of other knowledge using an approach we refer to as ‘sense–think–act’. This involves *reasoning* and corresponds more closely to the way humans solve complex problems and plan actions in the long and short term.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we do that, we’ll have a look in a bit more detail at another powerful idea in computer programming: *functions*. You’ve already met some of these, but without much explanation. So now let’s introduce you to them for real."

    "## 1.1 Defining simple Python functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the programs we have used so far have been quite short with little, if any, reused code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As programs get larger, it is often convenient to encapsulate several lines of code within a *function*. Multiple lines of code within a function can then be called conveniently from a single statement whenever they are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are very powerful, and if you have studied other programming courses then you may well be familiar with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the following provides a very quick overview of some of the key behaviours of Python functions. Remember that this isn’t a Python programming module *per se*; rather, it’s a module where we explore how to use Python to get things done. What follows should be enough to get you started writing your own functions, without creating too many bad habits along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how we can create our own functions, let’s consider a really simple example: a function that just prints out the word *Hello*.\n",

    "- the `FUNCTION_NAME` __MUST NOT__ contain any spaces or punctuation other than underscore (`_`) characters\n",
    "- the function name __MUST__ be followed by a pair of brackets (`()`), that may contain something (we’ll see what later), followed by a colon (`:`)\n",
    "- the body of the function __MUST__ be indented using space or tab characters; the level of indentation of the first line sets the effective ‘left-hand margin’ for the remaining lines of code in the function\n",
    "- the body of the function must include __AT LEAST__ one valid statement or line of code __EXCLUDING__ comments; if you don’t want the function to do anything, but need it as a placeholder, use `pass` as the single line of required code in the function body.\n",
