    "# 3 Emergent robot behaviour and simple data charts\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that you may be starting to realise about robot programming is that you don't always know *exactly* what will happen when your introduce your robot into a particular environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the programmer, you may be quite confident that you know what the robot will do when presented with any particular situation, such as a particular sensor reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a sense-act control strategy, the robot determines its actions in part based on its sensor readings. And those sensor readings are themselves are likely to be influenced by the behaviour of the robot as it acts in response to its sensor readings. Whilst the control strategy itself might be quite *simple*, the interaction between the robot and the world may be quite *complex* as a result of the feedback loop created by the robot changing its position in the environment as a result of a sensor reading made from that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a robot is placed into an environment, which in the real world is likely to be a *dynamically changing environment* in addition to the robot changing its own situation in the environment, predicting the overall behaviour of the robot may prove even more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "And for a bystander observing the behaviour of the robot and no knowledge of the control strategy in place, their perception of what the robot is doing, and maybe even the beliefs, desires and intentions they ascribe to the robot, may be far distinct from what the robot is actually programmed to do at a low level.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of this can be illustrated using Braitenberg Vehicles, where it is easy for an observer to want to ascribe high level, human style (anthropomorphised) behaviours to the robot, even if it is hardwired to perform in a particular way to a very simple stimulus (which is to say, sensory input).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll have an opportunity to experiment with some simple Braitenberg style vehicles in the RoboLab simulator. In order to help make sense of what the vehicles are doing, you'll also see how we can use the simulated robot to collect some sensor data logs that we can then visualise in order to see just what values the robot was responding to that caused it to behave as it did."

In (b) these connections are reversed.\n",

A Braitenberg vehicle and our simulated robot are very similar: they have two wheels, one each side, and two light sensors, one on the left and one on the right of the front of the robot. A pair of Braitenberg vehicles are shown, one light avoiding and one light seeking. A light-avoiding vehicle has the left-hand light sensor connected to the left-hand motor and wheel, and the right-hand light sensor connected to the right-hand motor and wheel. A light-seeking vehicle has the left-hand light sensor connected to the right-hand motor and wheel, and the right-hand light sensor connected to the left-hand wheel.

    "In some cases, we might be tempted to call the behaviours that emerge from the interaction of the control strategy with the environment as ‘intelligent’, or even to ascribe certain *desires* to the robot (such as ‘*it __wants__ to this*’). But that is not really what is happening: the robot is simply reacting to particular inputs in a particular way."
