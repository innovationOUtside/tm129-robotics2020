    "# 2 Dead reckoning\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dead reckoning* is a means of navigation that does not rely on external observations. Instead, a robot’s position is estimated by summing its incremental movements relative to a known starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimates of the distance traversed are usually obtained from measuring how many times the wheels have turned, and how many times they have turned in relation to each other. For example, the wheels of the robot could be attached to an odometer, similar to the device that records the mileage of a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RoboLab we will calculate the position of a robot from how long it moves in a straight line or rotates about its centre. We will assume that the length of time for which the motors are switched on is directly related to the distance travelled by the wheels."

For example, GPS doesn’t work indoors or underground, or even in many cities where line-of-sight access to four or more GPS satellites is not available.*\n",

We can model noise effects in the mobility system of our robot by adding a small amount of noise to the motor speeds as the simulator runs. This noise component may speed up or slow down the speed of each motor, in a random way. As with real systems, the noise represents slight random deviations from the theoretical, ideal behaviour.\n",

Using the robot's motor speeds and by monitoring how long the motors are switched on for, we can use distance time calculations to estimate out the robot's path. If we add in accurate measurements regarding how far we want the robot to travel, and in what direction, this provides one way of helping the robot to navigate to a particular waypoint.\n",
