# 3 The RoboLab simulated on-screen robot (`nbev3devsim`)


Within the Jupyter notebook environment, you will be making use of a simple two dimensional robot simulator, `nbev3devsim`. At times, we will refer the Jupyter notebook + `nbev3devsim` simulator, or just the simulator itself, as *RoboLab* (it's somewhat easier to say than `nbev3devsim`!)
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region -->
## 3.1 The `nbev3devsim` simulator 

The `nbev3devsim` simulator, will be the focus of many of the programming activities in this block, is derived from a simpler web based simulator, the [`ev3devsim` robot simulator](https://github.com/QuirkyCort/ev3dev-sim).

`ev3devsim` itself was inspired by the need to create a simulator for testing Python programs written for [`ev3dev`](https://www.ev3dev.org/), _"a Debian Linux-based operating system that runs on several LEGO® MINDSTORMS compatible platforms including the LEGO® MINDSTORMS EV3 and Raspberry Pi-powered BrickPi."_ 

Rather than saving programs to separate files, each individual robot simulator program is defined within its own notebook code cell, and can then be "downloaded" to the simulated robot. This means you can keep track of a how a program develops by writing each version of a program in its own code cell.

The simulator and world toggle buttons are shown as selected. ](../images/Section_00_02-nb3devsim_-_Jupyter_Notebook.png)


A wide range of predefined worlds is available that can be loaded into the simulator, as image files, from a drop down menu. (Source code for generating the background image files is also available in a notebook in the `backgrounds/` directory.) When some worlds are loaded in, the robot's initial (default) location in that world is also specified; other robot settings, such as the positioning of the sensors, may also be initialised when a particular background is loaded. 

Obstacles can be added to a world using a configuration file opened by clicking the *Obstacles config* button in the simulator *Settings* panel. The simulated robot is also still configured via a configuration panel.

The simulated robot can be dragged and placed on the simulated background or moved over and rotated within the simulator world using slider widgets. The `Reset` button will move the robot back to it's default location in the world.

## 3.2 The EV3 "brick"

The Lego Mindstorms EV3 robots that inspired `ev3dev`, `ev2devsim` and `nbev3devsim` are based around a physical EV3 controller with a 300 MHz ARM9 processor, 16 MB of Flash memory, 64 MB RAM and a Linux based operating system.

The controller is capable of supporting four motor outputs referred to as `OUTPUT A`, `OUTPUT B`, `OUTPUT C` and `OUTPUT D`. In the simulator, we define a simple two wheeled differential drive robot using two motors configured as follows:

- `OUTPUT B`: left motor;
- `OUTPUT C`: right motor.

The EV3 brick also support four input ports to which four different, independent sensors can be attached. These range from touch sensors, to light sensors, infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors and even gyroscopes. 

<!-- #region tags=["alert-warning"] -->
*Ports* are interfaces to the external world. Input *sensors* can be attached to the *input ports*, allowing information about the environment to enter the computer. Output *effectors*, such as *motors* and other actuators, can be attached to the output ports. The brick can switch such effectors on and off and control their direction and power. 
<!-- #endregion -->

The `nbev3devsim` simulator is capable of simulating simple robots such as the ones that can be built with LEGO Mindstorms. The simulator assumes that the simulated robot works like an EV3 brick. This means that the simulator needs to know what kinds of sensors and actuators are being used, and how the (simulated) EV3 robot is configured. You will see how this is done later.

Although I have described the simulated robot in terms of a simple Lego robot, similar considerations would apply to other robotics systems. The control subsystem of any robot is usually flexible and designed to be configured with a variety of sensors and actuators.

## 3.3 Background — `ev3dev` and the original `ev3devsim` simulator (optional)

<!-- #region hidden=true -->
Lego EV3 educational robots are widely used in all levels of education, including the Open University residential school course *T176 Engineering: professions, practice and skills 1*.

Low level functions provided by the `ev3dev` operating system are "wrapped" by the [ev3dev-lang-python](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang-python) Python 3 package. This means that a LEGO EV3 robot running the `ev3dev` operating system can be programmed using Python code.

The `ev3devsim` package implements a cut down version of the [`ev3dev-lang-python`] library to control a browser based, 2D-simulated robot. The `ev3devsim` Python code runs in a Skulpt interpreter (a browser based Python interpreter) to control a Javascript powered robot simulator.

The original [`ev3devsim`](https://github.com/QuirkyCort/ev3dev-sim) simulator ran as a [standalone web application](https://www.aposteriori.com.sg/Ev3devSim/index.html) that could be run, even in an offline mode, using just a web browser.

[![Screenshot of original ev3devsim simulator showing robot simulator canvas with simulated robot on a line following test track, the program editor containing a sample program, simulator program run controls (Run and Stop buttons) and a sensor data output window with example sensor output readings.](../images/EV3DEV_Python_Simulator.png)

Program code is entered into the editor window and run by clicking the simulator *Run* button.  Program files can be saved from, and loaded into the the program editor. An output window display messages sent from the program, such as sensor log values, as well as error messages if the program throws an error when it is run. A range of predefined worlds can be loaded into the simulator, as image files, from a drop down menu. Obstacles can be added to a world using a configuration file. The robot can be configured via a configuration menu and if required moved to a specified location. 

The [`nbev3devsim`](https://github.com/innovationOUtside/nbev3devsim) package builds on the original `ev3devsim` to provide an `ipywidget` that embeds the simulator in a Jupyter notebook. The simulated robot can be programmed using code downloaded from notebook code cells. Sensor data logged within the simulator can be exported to the notebook's own Python environment and analysed using the full power of Python's wide range of charting and data analysis packages.

Whilst the original `ev3devsim` simulator runs without any software requirements other than a modern web browser, the `nbev3devsim` approach does require the availability of a Jupyter notebook environment. Although this increases the complexity of the software environment, it does provide several benefits:

1. instructional material can be provided within a notebook to support each programming activity;
2. data retrieved from the simulator can be analysed and charted in the notebook kernel context (for example, using Python or R);
3. the notebook environment provides a read / write environment within which you can make your own notes and annotations, as well as keep a record of the various steps taken to develop any particular robot control program.

## 3.4 How the simulator relates to the notebooks

The simulator we are using is created as an interactive `ipywidget` that is embedded within a Jupyter notebook.

The simulator runs as a Javascript program in the browser tab associated with the notebook the simulator is embedded in. The simulator has various settings that can be configured within the simulator UI, or from the notebook commands that invoke it.

*For more technical details (optional), see the `99.1 nbev3devsim notebook architecture` notebook in the `99. Technical appendices` notebook directory.*

The simulator can be loaded into the notebook environment with the following code commands:

```python
from nbev3devsim.load_nbev3devwidget import roboSim, eds

%load_ext nbev3devsim
```

When the simulator is loaded, the presentation of the notebook is adjusted to shift the notebook content to a column at the left of the screen, with the simulator in a resizable, draggable widget that pops up on the right hand side of the screen.

<!-- #region tags=["alert-success"] -->
You can click on the right hand edge of the notebook column and drag it to the right or left to make the column wider or narrower respectively.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region activity=true -->
### 3.4.1 Activity — Load the `nbev3devsim` simulator into the notebook environment

Run the the code cell below to load in the simulator:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python activity=true
from nbev3devsim.load_nbev3devwidget import roboSim, eds

%load_ext nbev3devsim
```

Code is "downloaded" from a code cell in the notebook to the simulator by running the code cell with some special IPython *magic* in the first line of the cell.



<!-- #region tags=["alert-success"] -->
You can also get code into the simulator by highlighting and copying the code (without the IPython magic line) and then clicking the *Paste* button in the *Code display* panel in the simulator.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region activity=true -->
### 3.4.2 Activity — Downloading code to the simulator and running it there

Run the following code cell to download the code to the simulator. You may need to reposition and resize the widget to see the simulated robot in the simulator world view at the bottom of the widget.

__Note that a cell block magic identified by a double percent sign (`%%`) MUST be placed on the first line of the code cell.__
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region activity=true -->
Click the *Run* button in the simulator to run the downloaded code there. The robot should drive forwards a short distance and then stop.
<!-- #endregion -->

```python activity=true
%%sim_magic_preloaded

# Drive the robot forwards a short distance
tank_drive.on_for_rotations(SpeedPercent(50), SpeedPercent(50), 2)
tank_turn.on_for_rotations(-100, SpeedPercent(75), 2)
```

You will have an opportunity to explore the `nbev3devsim` simulator in a bit more detail in the next notebook.


### 3.4.3 Configuring the simulator layout

The simulator environment includes a range of user controls that can be used to configure the layout and view of the simulator user interface, as well as controlling operations performed within it. These include positioning the simulated robot, loading in different simulator backgrounds, loading obstacles into the simulated world, displaying status messages from the robot and dynamically charting logged sensor readings, as well as many other features.

You will be introduced to these in more detail as and when they are required.

A reference guide to the `nbev3devsim` user interface is also provided in the *99.2 nbev3devsim_user_interface* notebook in the `99. Technical appendices` notebook directory.
 


### 3.4.4 Creating and saving your own robot program code

The activities have been created within Jupyter notebooks using the embedded simulator widget. In many activities, you will have the opportunity to create and run your own programs to run within the simulator, as well as within the notebook's own Python coding environment.

Whilst it is possible to download and save code files loaded into the simulator, and load code back into the simulator from a saved file, we will generally download code from within a code cell to the simulator.

Saving the notebook will this keep a record of the code code you have downloaded and run in the simulator, although as with the state of the notebook Python environment, the internal state of the simulator is not saved when you save the notebook.


## 3.5 Summary

In this notebook, you have been introduced to the `nbev3devsim` simulator and its predecessor, the `ev3devsim` simulator. The `ev3devsim` simulator was itself inspired by `ev3dev`, a Linux based operating system for the Lego Mindstorms EV3 computer brick.

The `nbev3devsim` simulator thus represents a simple simulator environment that can be used to model the behaviour of real world EV3 controlled mobile robots, such as the ones used in Open University engineering residential schools.

In the next notebook, you will have an opportunity to explore how to configure and use the `nbev3devsim` simulator.

*But first: would you like to create your own summary cell for this notebook, and colour it to highlight it as your own work?*
