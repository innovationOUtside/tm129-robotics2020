    "\n",
    "`ev3devsim` itself was inspired by the need to create a simulator for testing Python programs written for [`ev3dev`](https://www.ev3dev.org/), _‘a Debian Linux-based operating system that runs on several LEGO® MINDSTORMS compatible platforms including the LEGO® MINDSTORMS EV3 and Raspberry Pi-powered BrickPi.’_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than saving programs to separate files, each individual robot simulator program is defined within its own notebook code cell, and can then be ‘downloaded’ to the simulated robot. This means you can keep track of a how a program develops by writing each version of a program in its own code cell. \n",

(Source code for generating the background image files is also available in a notebook in the `backgrounds/` directory.)
