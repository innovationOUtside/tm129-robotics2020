    "The `nbev3devsim` simulator allows robots to be configured using various components on specific input and output ports as defined in the `ev3dev` package developed for use with the EV3 Lego Mindstorms controller brick:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `OUTPUT_B`: left motor (state can be running or blank, not ramping, holding, overloaded, or stalled; stop action is ignored and the robot always stops instantly; `SpeedPercent`, `SpeedNativeUnits`, `SpeedRPS`, `SpeedRPM`, `SpeedDPS`, `SpeedDPM` are all defined, as are [`MotorSet`](https://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.io/projects/python-ev3dev/en/stable/motors.html#motor-set), [`MoveTank`](https://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.io/projects/python-ev3dev/en/stable/motors.html#move-tank) and [`MoveSteering`](https://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.io/projects/python-ev3dev/en/stable/motors.html#move-steering) motor groups);\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated robot also supports a range of sensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an ultrasonic sensor (`UltrasonicSensor`) that is polled at the relatively slow rate of 10 times a second and that can be used to detect obstacles ahead of the sensor with an angle of incidence of no more than 50 degrees. (This models the behaviour of an actual ultrasonic whereby if the angle of incidence is too large, the ultrasound signal is reflected away from the sensor and no reading is recorded);\n",
    "- one or more downward facing light / colour sensors (`ColorSensor`) that can be used to sense coloured readings on the world canvas directly below the sensor; sensors give readings of between 0..255; in `nbev3devsim`, access is also provided to the light sensor pixel array, which effectively models a simple, low resolution camera;\n",
    "- a gyroscope sensor (`GyroSensor`) that measures the angle of the robot in accumulated degrees turned since the sensor was enabled.\n",
    " \n",
    "The sensors are available on predefined sensor input ports. The ultrasonic and color sensors are mounted at default positions on the robot, although the position can be reconfigured using the robot configuration file:\n",
    "\n",

    "- `INPUT 2` : color sensor by default, mounted *front and left* on the robot; left [color sensor](https://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.io/projects/python-ev3dev/en/stable/sensors.html#color-sensor) (raw values ranges between 0 to 255; ambient_light_intensity will always return 0; color and color_name may not give the same value as the actual sensor);\n",
    "- `INPUT 3` : color sensor; by default, mounted *front and right* on the robot;  `INPUT 3`: right color sensor;\n",
    "- `INPUT 4` : gyro sensor; fixed location in the center of the robot; [gyro sensor](https://ev3dev-lang.readthedocs.io/projects/python-ev3dev/en/stable/sensors.html#gyro-sensor).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the T176 residential school, several activities are defined using different floorplans, such a circular racing track marked out a flat surface that the robots must navigate round as quickly as possible. Such activities are essentially \"two dimensional\" so you should not feel that just because the simulator we are using is essentially a two dimensional simulator you are not doing a realistic robot programming activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In actual fact, the simulator is more like 2.5D simulator in that it supports an obstacle layer that sits above the plane of the background and within which walls and other smaller obstacles can be detected by a simulated ultrasonic sensor. Note that to keep the \"world physics\" provided by the simulation as simple as possible, the obstacles do not, in fact, impede the progress of the simulated robot.\n",
