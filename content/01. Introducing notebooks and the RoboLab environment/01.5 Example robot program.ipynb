    "This notebook started with a demonstration of the sort of behaviour we can program our simulated RoboLab robot to perform inside the simulator, specifically, moving around and staying inside a box. You then saw, line by line, how the program was constructed to perform the task, including: the use of cell magic at the start of the cell to identify the code that followed as code to be downloaded to the simulator the use of comments in the program code; the use of nested code blocks within loop and conditional statements; and the use of print statements that could report messages to the simulator *Output* display window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator itself also uses the *Output* display window to alert us to errors within our program when we try to run it. In many cases, errors are identified with an associated line number. Using the simulator *Code display*, you can preview the whole program downloaded to the simulator, not just the explicitly written code in a magicked code cell, along with line numbers to help find the erroneous code line in the context of the complete program around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you also saw how we can use the simulator magics to prepend different amounts of standard boilerplate code to our program before downloading it to the simulator. In particular, the boilerplate code could import several essential packages as well as preconfiguring the motor drives and sensor variables on our behalf and providing us with a means for letting the robot speak for itself.\n",
