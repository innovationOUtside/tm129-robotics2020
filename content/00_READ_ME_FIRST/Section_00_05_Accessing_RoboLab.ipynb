    "RoboLab is an example of an `Open Computing Lab (OCL)` environment configured specifically to support your TM129 activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Open Computing Lab` approach is being trialled on several Open University modules and aims to provide a common approach to delivering complex software and computing envronments on personal computers as well as via remotely hosted online servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways in which you can access the RoboLab OCL environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *as a \"temporary\" online service using MyBinder*\n",
    "- <s>*via the OU hosted JupyterHub environment WHICH DOESN'T EXIST YET*</s>\n",

    "To run an Open Computing Lab environment on your computer, we suggest you install the prebuilt OCL environment developed for your module. For TM129, this is the prebuilr RoboLab environment. Using this environment has the advantage that the module team knows exactly what's inside it and how to help fix things if they appear to go wrong.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is quite possible to launch the RoboLab virtual environment from a terminal / command prompt and then access the actual environment via your browser in the normal way, although it is slightly more fiddly than using ContainDS.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### On a Mac / Linux Machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a terminal. From the command prompt, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- create a working directory / folder to work in by entering the command: `mkdir TM129`;\n",
    "- change directory into that directory by running the command: `cd TM129`;\n",
    "- start the container by running the command: `docker run --name tm129test -p 8129:8888 -v $PWD:/home/jovyan/notebooks -e JUPYTER_TOKEN=\"letmein\" ousefuldemos/tm129-robotics2020:latest`\n",

    "- change directory into that directory by running the command: `cd TM129`;\n",
    "- check the current directory path: `cd`. Assuming it returns something like `C:\\\\users\\YOURUSER\\TM129`, start the container by running the command: `docker run --name tm129test --rm -d -p 8897:8888 -v //C/users/YOURUSER/TM129/notebooks:/home/jovyan/notebooks  ousefuldemos/tm351-binderised:latest`\n",
    "\n",
    "__TO DO: does this require the notebooks dir to be available? If so: `mkdir notebooks` before the `docker run...` command.__\n",
    "In Windows, you cannot mount on to a non-empty directory inside the container. You can, however, define and automaticaly create your own directory. For it to be visible to the notebook server homepage, the shared directory needs to be mounted along the `/home/jovyan/' directory path. For example, `-v c:\\tm129share\\notebooks:c:\\home\\jovyan\\mySharedDirectory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Once the Docker Container is running...\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the `docker run ...` command, several things will happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- first, docker will download the container image from DockerHub (this may take some time but only happens the first time you try to run the container);\n",
    "- then, docker will launch the container and a Jupyter notebook server will start running inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the container is running, go to `localhost:8129` in your browser (if that doesn't work, try `http://127.0.0.1:8129`) and you should see a running notebook server there.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### What to do if the Token isn't set or doesn't work\n",
    "As a simple security measure, the notebook server requires a token or password the first time the server is accessed from a particular web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the token you have tried does not work, or if you did not start the container with the `-e JUPYTER_TOKEN=\"letmein\"` environmental variable setting, you will need to find the token used to access the notebook server. Run the command-line command:\n",
