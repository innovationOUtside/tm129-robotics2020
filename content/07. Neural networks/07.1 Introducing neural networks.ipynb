    "# 1.1 Making sense of images\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, great advances have been made in generating powerful neural network-based models often referred to as ‘deep learning’ models (LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y. and Hinton, G., 2015, *Deep learning*, nature, 521(7553), pp.436-444, doi:10.1038/nature14539). But neural networks have been around for over 50 years, with advances every few years, often reflecting advances in computing, and more recently, the ready availability of large amounts of raw training data, and then long periods of ‘AI Winter’ when not much progress appeared to be being made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following XKCD cartoon, [*Tasks*](https://xkcd.com/1425/), was first published in 2014. As is typical of XKCD cartoons, hovering over the cartoon reveals some hidden caption text. In this particular case: ‘_In the 60s, Marvin Minsky assigned a couple of undergrads to spend the summer programming a computer to use a camera to identify objects in a scene. He figured they'd have the problem solved by the end of the summer. Half a century later, we're still working on it_.’ \n",

    "[![](../images/xkcd_tasks.png)](https://xkcd.com/1425/)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time (this is only a few short years ago, remember), recognising arbitrary items in images was still a hard task and the sentiment of this cartoon rang true. But within a few months, advances in neural network research meant that AI models capable of performing similar tasks, albeit crudely and with limited success, had started to appear. Today, photographs are routinely tagged with labels that identify what can be seen in the photograph using much larger, much more powerful, and much more effective AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, identifying individual objects in an image on the one hand, and being able to generate a sensible caption that describes the image, is a different matter. A quick web search today will undoubtedly turn up some very enticing demos out there of automated caption generators. But ‘reading the scene’ presented by a picture and generating a caption from a set or keywords or tags associated with items that can be recognised in the image is an altogether more complex task: as well as performing the object recognition task correctly, we also need to be able to identify the relationships that exist between the different parts of the image; and do that in a meaningful way.\n"

If the network’s suggested label matches the training label, then the network model is ‘rewarded’ and its parameters updated so that it is more likely to give that desired answer for that sort of image in future. If the prediction does not match the training label, then the model parameters are updated so that the model is less likely to make that incorrect prediction in future and more likely to assign the correct training label.\n",
