# 5 Challenge â€” coping with noise

Using The *Noisy_Lollipop* background in the simulator, see if you can refine your program, or my program, to complete the challenge of following the line and stopping on the red bar.

Trying to solve challenges like this can be both frustrating and time consuming, so try to keep an eye on the clock and don't spend more that ten or fifteen minutes trying to complete the challenge.

If you think you have come up with a good solution, feel free to share it via the module forums.
