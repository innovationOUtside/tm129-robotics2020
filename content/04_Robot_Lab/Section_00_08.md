### Challenge A

Try writing a program that can navigate the robot around Course A (Figure 8.1). The background image you require is `challenge-A.bmp`, which you will find in the `week-5` folder.

### Challenge B

Try writing a program that can navigate the robot around Course B (Figure 8.1). The background image you require is `challenge-B.bmp`, which you will find in the `week-5` folder.

### Challenge C

*Note: This challenge is extremely difficult. To date, no one in the module team has conquered it.*

Try writing a program that can navigate the robot around Course C (Figure 8.1). The background image you require is `challenge-C.bmp`, which you will find in the `week-5` folder.

Figure 8.1 The Simon navigation challenges: A, B and C


Some complex patterns for a robot to follow. The first is based on a square grid and forms a trail which repeatedly crosses itself at right angles, forming a series of interlocking squares and rectangles. The second is a series of six small circles, just touching each other and arranged around the perimeter of a circle. The final pattern is reminiscent of a seal balancing a ball on its nose! The body of the seal is formed of gentle curves, but there are sharp angles for flippers and tails, and the ball is a complete circle.

This is the end of Robot Lab Session 5.
