<font color='red'>JD: I suggest merging this very short notebook with the following notebook (and renaming the notebooks).</font>

# Introduction


The main purpose of this session is to consider how robots can navigate in the world. First, we will see how to use ultrasound sensors to detect obstacles.

Then you will learn how we can use motor tachometer sensors that allow the simulated robot to keep track of how far it has travelled (or at least, how many times its wheels have turned round!) and a gyroscope to monitor the direction in which the robot is pointing.

As usual, this session contains some activities and challenges. It finishes with some optional challenges to navigate a robot in worlds cluttered up with blocks.
