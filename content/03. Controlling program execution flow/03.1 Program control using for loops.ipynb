    "Loops and branches are powerful constructs in programming, and they are used extensively in almost all computer programs. In this session, I will introduce the different loop and branch statements provided by RoboLab. You will have an opportunity to see how they are used by working through the activities. We end the session with a number of challenges for you to attempt. These will give you practice in selecting and using different RoboLab statements.\n",

    "In particular, this notebook will focus on *loops* and the next notebook on *branches*. Two further notebooks will provide you with a series of challenges to help develop your understanding of how these sorts of construction can be used in the context of some simple robot programming tasks."

From this box an arrow leads to a decision diamond labelled ‘Is the count less than 20?’ Two arrows lead from this: one labelled ‘Yes’, the other ‘No’. The ‘Yes’ branch leads back to rejoin the box ‘Swim a length’. The ‘No’ branch leads directly to an oval shape labelled ‘End’.

The arrow from this box leads to a decision diamond ‘Is counter < 4?’ Two arrows lead from this, one labelled ‘Yes’, the other ‘No’. The ‘Yes’ branch loops back to rejoin the sequence at ‘# Draw side code’. The ‘No’ branch leads directly to an oval ‘End’. There is thus a loop in the chart which includes the sequence of motor control commands, incrementing the counter and ends with the decision ‘Is counter < 4?’.](../images/flowchart_square.jpeg)](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/#/edit/eyJjb2RlIjoiZ3JhcGggVERcbiAgICBBKFN0YXJ0KSAtLT4gQltTZXQgY291bnRlciB0byAwXVxuICAgIEIgLS0-IENbIyBEcmF3IHNpZGU8YnIvPi4uLmNvZGUuLi5dXG4gICAgQyAtLT4gRFsjIFR1cm4gbmluZXR5IGRlZ3JlZXM8YnIvPi4uLmNvZGUuLi5dXG4gICAgRCAtLT4gRVtBZGQgMSB0byBjb3VudGVyXVxuICAgIEUgLS0-IEZ7SXMgY291bnRlciA8IDQ_fVxuICAgIEYgLS0-IHxZZXN8IENcbiAgICBGIC0tPiB8Tm98IEcoRW5kKSIsIm1lcm1haWQiOnsidGhlbWUiOiJkZWZhdWx0IiwidGhlbWVWYXJpYWJsZXMiOnsiYmFja2dyb3VuZCI6IndoaXRlIiwicHJpbWFyeUNvbG9yIjoiI0VDRUNGRiIsInNlY29uZGFyeUNvbG9yIjoiI2ZmZmZkZSIsInRlcnRpYXJ5Q29sb3IiOiJoc2woODAsIDEwMCUsIDk2LjI3NDUwOTgwMzklKSIsInByaW1hcnlCb3JkZXJDb2xvciI6ImhzbCgyNDAsIDYwJSwgODYuMjc0NTA5ODAzOSUpIiwic2Vjb25kYXJ5Qm9yZGVyQ29sb3IiOiJoc2woNjAsIDYwJSwgODMuNTI5NDExNzY0NyUpIiwidGVydGlhcnlCb3JkZXJDb2xvciI6ImhzbCg4MCwgNjAlLCA4Ni4yNzQ1MDk4MDM5JSkiLCJwcmltYXJ5VGV4dENvbG9yIjoiIzEzMTMwMCIsInNlY29uZGFyeVRleHRDb2xvciI6IiMwMDAwMjEiLCJ0ZXJ0aWFyeVRleHRDb2xvciI6InJnYig5LjUwMDAwMDAwMDEsIDkuNTAwMDAwMDAwMSwgOS41MDAwMDAwMDAxKSIsImxpbmVDb2xvciI6IiMzMzMzMzMiLCJ0ZXh0Q29sb3IiOiIjMzMzIiwibWFpbkJrZyI6IiNFQ0VDRkYiLCJzZWNvbmRCa2ciOiIjZmZmZmRlIiwiYm9yZGVyMSI6IiM5MzcwREIiLCJib3JkZXIyIjoiI2FhYWEzMyIsImFycm93aGVhZENvbG9yIjoiIzMzMzMzMyIsImZvbnRGYW1pbHkiOiJcInRyZWJ1Y2hldCBtc1wiLCB2ZXJkYW5hLCBhcmlhbCIsImZvbnRTaXplIjoiMTZweCIsImxhYmVsQmFja2dyb3VuZCI6IiNlOGU4ZTgiLCJub2RlQmtnIjoiI0VDRUNGRiIsIm5vZGVCb3JkZXIiOiIjOTM3MERCIiwiY2x1c3RlckJrZyI6IiNmZmZmZGUiLCJjbHVzdGVyQm9yZGVyIjoiI2FhYWEzMyIsImRlZmF1bHRMaW5rQ29sb3IiOiIjMzMzMzMzIiwidGl0bGVDb2xvciI6IiMzMzMiLCJlZGdlTGFiZWxCYWNrZ3JvdW5kIjoiI2U4ZThlOCIsImFjdG9yQm9yZGVyIjoiaHNsKDI1OS42MjYxNjgyMjQzLCA1OS43NzY1MzYzMTI4JSwgODcuOTAxOTYwNzg0MyUpIiwiYWN0b3JCa2ciOiIjRUNFQ0ZGIiwiYWN0b3JUZXh0Q29sb3IiOiJibGFjayIsImFjdG9yTGluZUNvbG9yIjoiZ3JleSIsInNpZ25hbENvbG9yIjoiIzMzMyIsInNpZ25hbFRleHRDb2xvciI6IiMzMzMiLCJsYWJlbEJveEJrZ0NvbG9yIjoiI0VDRUNGRiIsImxhYmVsQm94Qm9yZGVyQ29sb3IiOiJoc2woMjU5LjYyNjE2ODIyNDMsIDU5Ljc3NjUzNjMxMjglLCA4Ny45MDE5NjA3ODQzJSkiLCJsYWJlbFRleHRDb2xvciI6ImJsYWNrIiwibG9vcFRleHRDb2xvciI6ImJsYWNrIiwibm90ZUJvcmRlckNvbG9yIjoiI2FhYWEzMyIsIm5vdGVCa2dDb2xvciI6IiNmZmY1YWQiLCJub3RlVGV4dENvbG9yIjoiYmxhY2siLCJhY3RpdmF0aW9uQm9yZGVyQ29sb3IiOiIjNjY2IiwiYWN0aXZhdGlvbkJrZ0NvbG9yIjoiI2Y0ZjRmNCIsInNlcXVlbmNlTnVtYmVyQ29sb3IiOiJ3aGl0ZSIsInNlY3Rpb25Ca2dDb2xvciI6InJnYmEoMTAyLCAxMDIsIDI1NSwgMC40OSkiLCJhbHRTZWN0aW9uQmtnQ29sb3IiOiJ3aGl0ZSIsInNlY3Rpb25Ca2dDb2xvcjIiOiIjZmZmNDAwIiwidGFza0JvcmRlckNvbG9yIjoiIzUzNGZiYyIsInRhc2tCa2dDb2xvciI6IiM4YTkwZGQiLCJ0YXNrVGV4dExpZ2h0Q29sb3IiOiJ3aGl0ZSIsInRhc2tUZXh0Q29sb3IiOiJ3aGl0ZSIsInRhc2tUZXh0RGFya0NvbG9yIjoiYmxhY2siLCJ0YXNrVGV4dE91dHNpZGVDb2xvciI6ImJsYWNrIiwidGFza1RleHRDbGlja2FibGVDb2xvciI6IiMwMDMxNjMiLCJhY3RpdmVUYXNrQm9yZGVyQ29sb3IiOiIjNTM0ZmJjIiwiYWN0aXZlVGFza0JrZ0NvbG9yIjoiI2JmYzdmZiIsImdyaWRDb2xvciI6ImxpZ2h0Z3JleSIsImRvbmVUYXNrQmtnQ29sb3IiOiJsaWdodGdyZXkiLCJkb25lVGFza0JvcmRlckNvbG9yIjoiZ3JleSIsImNyaXRCb3JkZXJDb2xvciI6IiNmZjg4ODgiLCJjcml0QmtnQ29sb3IiOiJyZWQiLCJ0b2RheUxpbmVDb2xvciI6InJlZCIsImxhYmVsQ29sb3IiOiJibGFjayIsImVycm9yQmtnQ29sb3IiOiIjNTUyMjIyIiwiZXJyb3JUZXh0Q29sb3IiOiIjNTUyMjIyIiwiY2xhc3NUZXh0IjoiIzEzMTMwMCIsImZpbGxUeXBlMCI6IiNFQ0VDRkYiLCJmaWxsVHlwZTEiOiIjZmZmZmRlIiwiZmlsbFR5cGUyIjoiaHNsKDMwNCwgMTAwJSwgOTYuMjc0NTA5ODAzOSUpIiwiZmlsbFR5cGUzIjoiaHNsKDEyNCwgMTAwJSwgOTMuNTI5NDExNzY0NyUpIiwiZmlsbFR5cGU0IjoiaHNsKDE3NiwgMTAwJSwgOTYuMjc0NTA5ODAzOSUpIiwiZmlsbFR5cGU1IjoiaHNsKC00LCAxMDAlLCA5My41Mjk0MTE3NjQ3JSkiLCJmaWxsVHlwZTYiOiJoc2woOCwgMTAwJSwgOTYuMjc0NTA5ODAzOSUpIiwiZmlsbFR5cGU3IjoiaHNsKDE4OCwgMTAwJSwgOTMuNTI5NDExNzY0NyUpIn19LCJ1cGRhdGVFZGl0b3IiOmZhbHNlfQ)"

    "In this notebook, you have seen how we can use the `nbtutor` extension to step through and monitor the flow of simple Python programs executing in the notebook’s Python environment (unfortunately, it does not allow us to step through code we download into the simulator and breaks program downloads to the simulator widget after using the tutor).\n",
    "\n",
    "At a programming level, you have seen how we can control the way in which program statements are executed in a program by using a `for..in..` loop to control a program's execution flow. The `for...in...` loop allows a program to work through a set of statements in the loop body once for each item in a list of values or ‘iterator’ construct. Using the `range()` function, you were able to iterate through a loop a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also met another flow control statement: the `if...` command. The `if` command is a conditional operator that checks a logical condition once and once only: if the tested condition evaluates as true, then control passes inside the block, and then continues after the if block; if the condition evaluates as false, then control passes immediately to the statement after the if block. (You will meet the `if` command in even more detail in a later notebook...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional `if` statement can be used within a  `for` loop to interrupt the control flow within the loop either by foreshortening code execution with in the the loop (`continue`) or breaking out of the loop (`break`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `continue` prematurely forces the flow of control back to the top of the loop, rather than requiring all the instructions in the loop to execute and then passing control back to the top of the loop\n",
    "- `break` prematurely forces the flow of control out of the loop to the next statement after the loop block, rather than requiring control to be passed following the failure of the conditional test at the top of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control flow instructions are part of the core Python language and are used in a similar way inside in the simulator and the ‘native’ notebook Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, you will meet another form of loop control that combines loop execution with an inbuilt conditional test: the `while` loop."
