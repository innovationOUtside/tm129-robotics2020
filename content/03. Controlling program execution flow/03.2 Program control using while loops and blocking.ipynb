    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you have seen how we can control the way in which program statements are executed in a program using a `while` loop, which checks a condition at start of each loop and then either passes control to the first line inside the block if the condition evaluates `True`, with control return to the top of the loop, and another conditional test, once the code inside the loop has been evaluated. When the loop's conditional test fails (that is, it evaluates as `False`) control is passed to the next statement in the program outside the while block.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the `for...in..` loop, control flow within a `while` loop can also be interrupted using `continue` and `break` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned how certain statements are \"blocking\" of control flow, in that rather than being evaluated in a near instantaneous fashion, they may take some time to complete before passing control to the next program statement. Blocking commands include `time.sleep(s)`, `say(message, wait=True)` and the motor commands `.on_for_rotations()` and `.on_for_seconds()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using blocking statements within a robot control program can lead to behaviours that are not desired, not least because they may prevent the timely inspection of sensor values that are used to determine robot behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll look in a bit more detail at one of the control flow statements you have already met in passing: the conditional `if` branch control flow statement."
