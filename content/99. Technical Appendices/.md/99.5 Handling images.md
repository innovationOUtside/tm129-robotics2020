# Appendix â€“ Handling images

One of the advantages of using the Python `PIL` package is that a range of *methods* (that is, *functions*) are defined on each image object that allow us to manipulate it *as an image*. (We can then also access the data defining the transformed image *as data* if we need it in that format.)

Several activities involve the manipulation of images. In this technical appendix, we will review some of the supported operations provided by the `nn_tools` package.


## Loading images

We can load a test image in as an image using the `PIL.Image` package:

```python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('.images/example_mnist_4.png')
img
```

We can review the image size:

```python
img.size
```

We can zoom the image display:

```python
from nn_tools.sensor_data import zoom_img

zoom_img(img)
```

We can get the raw data as an iterator and cast it to a `numpy` array:

```python
import numpy as np

# Preview the first two rows
np.array(img)[:2]
```

We can view the image data in a dataframe:

```python
from nn_tools.sensor_data import df_from_image

df_from_image(img, show=False)
```

As well as returning the dataframe, we can render a heat map view of it:

```python
_ = df_from_image(img, show=True)
```

We can automatically trim the background area around the image:

```python
from nn_tools.sensor_data import trim_image

trimmed_image = trim_image( df_from_image(image_image), background=0)
```

We can resize the image:

```python
img_20x20 = img.resize((20, 20))

zoom_img(img_20x20)
```

We can manually crop the image to an area of interest:

```python
# The crop area is (x, y, x + side, y + side)
cropped_image = img_20x20.crop((3, 3, 17, 17));
                       
zoom_img(cropped_image)
```
