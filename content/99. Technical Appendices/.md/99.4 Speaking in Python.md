# Appendix — Speaking in Python

This appendix provides additional explanatory material that offers an insight into some of the technical issues associated with creating speech actions in a Jupyter notebook context as well as creating speech actions in a pure Python environment.

The robot simulator speech action is built up from a JavaScript function that builds on a built-in browser function for creating speech utterances. We can force the Jupyter notebook to run JavaScript code in the browser from a code cell using the `%%javascript` cell magic. This means we can get the browser to ‘speak’ by calling the browser speech functions via JavaScript directly.

*Note that there may be a brief delay between running the code cell and hearing the speech utterance.*

```javascript
speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("hello"))
```

We can also create a simple wrapper around a JavaScript call that we can use in a Jupyter notebook context to speak, via the browser, from a Python statement:

```python pinned_outputs=[]
from IPython.display import Javascript

class Speech():
    def say(self, txt):
        display(Javascript(f'speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("{txt}"))'))

speaker = Speech()
speaker.say('hello')
```

We can also create a simple Python program to count aloud up to 10, for example by using a `while` loop:

```python
n = 1

while n <= 10:
    speaker.say(n)
    n = n + 1
```

As currently defined, there is no way we can stop the `speaker` from counting unless we reload this notebook webpage.
