We then retrieved this data from a synchronised datalog in the Python environment when we had completed the data collection activity.\n",

In particular, we will make use of a communication mechanism where the robot can send data back to the notebook environment for analysis.

    "In this notebook, you have seen how we can create a simple protocol that allows the passage of messages between the robot and Python agent in a simple multi-agent system. The Python agent picks up the message received from the robot, parses it and decodes it as an image. The image is then classified by an MLP and the agent responds to the robot with a predicted image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also saw how we can use a particular type of diagram, often referred to as a *sequence diagram*, to describe the passage of messages between several different actors in a communication system. Specialised diagram types play a significant role in many engineering disciplines for depicting in a structured way a visual description of a system or a visual summary of its anticipated operational behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst we only considered how our Python agent might call on a neural network to support our remote simulated robot agent, you might also conclude, correctly, that we could also use a \"traditional\" sequential program, or even a rule based system, to perform \"off-board\" tasks on behalf of the robot.\n",
