    "# 1 An introduction to remote services and multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, you had an opportunity to experiment hands-on with some neural networks. You may have finished that lab session wondering how neural networks can be built into real robots, particularly low-cost robots rather than expensive cutting-edge robots found only in research labs. In this session, you will find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot simulator we're using was originally designed to simulate the behaviour of a Lego Mindstorms EV3 controlled robot. The EV3 brick is excellent for introductory robotics, but it has limitations in terms of processor speed and memory capacity. This makes it impractical to train anything other than a small neural network on a Lego EV3 robot, although we may be able to use pre-trained models to perform \"on-device\" classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we are often faced with the problem that we may want to run powerful programs on low-cost hardware that really isn't up to the job. Upgrading a robot with a more powerful processor might not be a solution because it adds cost and may demand extra electrical power or create heat management issues: driving a processor hard can generate a lot of heat, and you need to remove that heat somehow. Heatsinks are heavy and take up physical space, and cooling fans are heavy, take up space, and need access to power. As you add more mass, you need more powerful motors, which themselves add mass and require more power. Bigger batteries add more mass, so you can see where this argument leads...\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible alternative is to think about using remote services or *multi-agent* systems approaches. In either case, we might use a low-cost robot as a mobile agent to gather data and send that back to a more-powerful computer for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, we might think of the robot as a remote data collector, collecting data on our behalf and then returning that data to us in response to a request for it. In the RoboLab environment we might think of the notebook Python environment as our local computing environment and the robot as a remote service. Every so often, we might *pull* data from the robot by making a request for a copy of it from the notebook so that we can then analyse the data at our leisure. Alternatively, each time the robot collects a dataset, it might *push* a copy of the data to the notebook's Python environment. In each case, we might think of this as \"uploading\" data from the simulated robot back to the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a bit like asking a research librarian for some specific information, the research librarian researching the topic, perhaps using resources you don't have direct access to, and then the research librarian providing you with the information you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more dynamic multi-agent case, we might consider the robot and the notebook environment to be acting as peers sending messages as and when they can between each other. For example, we might have two agents: a Lego mobile robot and a personal computer (PC), or the simulated robot and the notebook.  In computational terms, *agents* are long-lived computational systems that can deliberate on the actions they may take in pursuit of their own goals based on their own internal state (often referred to as \"beliefs\") and sensory inputs. Their actions are then performed by means of some sort of effector system that can act to change the state of the environment within which they reside.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multi-agent system, two or more agents may work together to combine to perform some task that not only meets the (sub)goals of each individual agent, but that might also strive to attain some goal agreed on by each member of the multi-agent system. Agents may communicate by making changes to the environment, for example, by leaving a trail that other agents may follow (an effect known as *stigmergy*), or by passing messages between themselves directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To a limited extent, we may view our simulated robot / Python system as a model for a simple multi-agent system where two agents — the robot, and the classifying neural network or deliberative rule-based system, for example — work together to perform the task of classifying and identifying patterns in some environment that the individual agents could not achieve by themselves. We let the robot do what it does best – move around while logging data – and then it actively sends the data back to the notebook Python environment for processing. The Python environment processes the data using a trained neural network, or perhaps a complex rule-based system, and sends back a message to the robot giving an appropriate response. In each case, the two agents act independently, sending messages to the other party when they have data or a classification to share, rather than just responding to requests for data or a particular service as they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will explore how we might use the simulated robot as a remote data collector. Every so often, we will grab a copy of the logged data into the notebook Python environment and analyse it within the notebook."
