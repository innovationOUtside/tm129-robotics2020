    "In the Asimov short story ‘Runaround’ in *I, Robot* there is an interaction between the potential due to the instruction given to collect selenium (*Second Law: obey a human*), and Speedy’s strong self-preservation potential (*Third Law: protect its own existence*). In this section you are going to see how such conflicting potentials interact in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of modelling a potential map is to think of it in geographical terms, with the potential map represented as a ‘landscape’ over an area. Areas of high potential are represented by high points in the landscape; areas of low potential are represented as valleys. We can take the modelling step one step further, and represent this landscape using a topographical map, where high points are represented by bright colours, and low areas are represented by dark colours.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was hoping to use a background that is actually generated from topographic map data (that is, geographical height data) from NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) to model the presence of selenium deposits. ‘High’, brightly coloured areas were to be imagined as corresponding to areas nominally rich in selenium; ‘low’ areas would correspond to areas nominally low in selenium. But as the robot was never quite as well (or as usefully badly!) behaved in the terrain  as I’d hoped it would be, instead we’ll be using a simple simulation of the actual topography data.\n",
