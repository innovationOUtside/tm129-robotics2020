    "In the Asimov short story ‘Runaround’ in *I, Robot* there is a situation where there is a conflict between the instruction given to collect selenium (*Second Law: obey a human*), and Speedy’s (the robot’s) strong self-preservation potential (*Third Law: protect its own existence*), which is endangered by the gases around the selenium pool. In this notebook you are going to see how such conflicts, which are often represented as conflicting potentials, can affect a robot’s behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the conflicting potentials vary from point to point in the space, we can think of these as potential maps. One way of modelling a potential map is to think of it in geographical terms, with the potential map represented as a ‘landscape’ over an area. Areas of high potential are represented by high points in the landscape; areas of low potential are represented as valleys. We can take the modelling step one step further, and represent this landscape using a topographical map, where high points are represented by bright colours, and low areas are represented by dark colours.\n",
