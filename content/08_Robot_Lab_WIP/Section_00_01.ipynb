    "In the previous session, you had an opportunity to experiment hands-on with some neural networks. You may have finished that lab session wondering how neural networks can be built into real robots, particularly low-cost robots rather than expensive cutting-edge robots found only in research labs. In this session, you will find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot simulator we're using was originally designed to simulate the behaviour of a Lego Mindstorms EV3 controlled robot. The EV3 brick is excellent for introductory robotics, but it has limitations: it has a limited amount of memory, and it only supports integer arithmetic. This makes it impractical to train anything other than a small neural network on a Lego EV3 robot, although we may be able to use pre-trained models to perform \"on-device\" classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we are often faced with the problem that we may want to run powerful programs on low-cost hardware that really isn't up to the job. Upgrading a robot with a more powerful processor might not be a solution because it adds cost and may demand extra electrical power. In turn, this might require a larger battery, which adds more weight. Which means you need more powerful electrical motors to move the robot, a bigger power supply to drive the motors, and more weight. You can probably see where this argument leads?!\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible alternative is to think about a *multi-agent* systems approach, using a low-cost robot as a mobile agent to gather data and send that back to a powerful computer for processing. In a simple case we might have two agents: a Lego mobile robot and a personal computer (PC). We let the Lego robot do what it does best – move around while logging data – and then send the data back to the PC for processing. The PC processes the data using a trained neural network, or perhaps a complex rule based system, and sends back a message to the robot giving an appropriate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will explore various ways in which our simulated robot can \"offload\" a task such as a recognition task to an external service operating elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "*ROS*, the *Robot Operating System*, provides one possible architecture for implementing such systems. In a ROS environment, separate *nodes* publish details of one or more *services* they can perform along with *topics* that act act as the nodes address that other nodes can subscribe. Nodes then pass messages between each other in order to perform a particular task. The ROS architecture is rather elaborate for our needs, however, so we shall use a much simpler and more direct approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we will use, although much simpler approach than the full ROS architecture, will also be based on a message passing approach. To begin with, we will train a simple MLP network using the MNIST digits data in the Python environment attached to the notebook. We will then log image sensor data from the simulated robot and copy it into the notebook data log. From the data in the data log, we will then see if the MLP can recognise the digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing this approach, we will then explore a simple message passing protocol where the simulated robot sends a message to the Python environment containing the image sensor data, the data is run through the MLP, and the classification response is sent back to the simulated robot."
