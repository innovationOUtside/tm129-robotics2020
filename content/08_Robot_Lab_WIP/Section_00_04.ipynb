These slight changes may cause large changes in the raw pixel values.\n",

In that case, the various fruits were recognised based on physical properties of the each fruit in the form of the dimensions of the bounding box drawn around each one, rather than the actual picture of the fruit. The features used for training and recall in that case were thus the bounding box dimensions.\n",
