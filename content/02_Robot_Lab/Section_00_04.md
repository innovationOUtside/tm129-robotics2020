# 4 Optional challenges


These challenges are more difficult, so we've made them optional. If you want more programming experience before tackling these challenges you can always come back to this section later in the block.


### Challenge: Fitness Training Take 3

Modify the programme you developed for the *Fitness Training Take 2* challenge so that the robot travels the same distance as the first traverse on the third and final traverse, and double the first distance on the second traverse.

Download your programme to the simulator and run it to check that it performs as required.

```python

```

### Challenge: Fitness Training Take 4

Modify the programme you developed for the *Fitness Training Take 3* challenge so that the robot can easily be tasked with performing any number of traverses. On odd numbered traverses it should travel a short distance, on even numbered traverses it should travel twice that difference.

Download your programme to the simulator and run it to check that it performs as required.

```python

```
