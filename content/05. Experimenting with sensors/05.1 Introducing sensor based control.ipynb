    "In this notebook, you have explored two different strategies for getting a robot to follow a line, using thought experiments to put yourself into the mind of the robot and imagine what it could see in order to help you come up with a control strategy for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy, to create a *line follower*, used two light sensors that straddled the line and identify whether the robot was straddling the line or was starting to veer over one side or the other of it. (Strictly, we would require a third sensor in the middle of the other two to confirm we were over the line. Or just slightly reduce the gap between the left and right sensors to give a low reading corresponding to seeing just a part of the line rather than the pure white background.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy only required a single light sensor, which the robot used to follow the *edge* of a specified side of the line, turning forwards and away from the line when it detected it and forwards and towards the line when it was off it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, the sensor values we used were essentially free of noise. In the next notebook, you will start to learn how noise can complicate simple control strategies and how we might start to accommodate it."
